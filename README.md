# ADVANCED DATASTRUCTURES
<br>In this respository you will learn to create Trees its traversal(also without recursion), searches and deletion,
<br>
<br> BinaryTree -> Create,CreateTree, Inorder, preorder, postorder, search of BT,deletion
<br>
<br>BinarySearchTree -> Create,InsertNode, Inorder, preorder, postorder,(without recursive traversal also), search of BST,void deletion
<br>
<br> AVL Tree ->Height,balance factor,max,left rotate,right rotate,create node,inorder,preorder,postorder.
<br><br>->Fibonacci Search.
